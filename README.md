What was done in this project(Description):
* The main focus of this project was learning the use of react-router . So, I applied  React-router to navigate pages from one place to another.
* Also I applied Re-chart and added a bar chart and showed it on the Statistics page UI.
*  I also applied toast component with help of "tostify" package to use it to verify answer of a quiz given by an user valid or not.
* I made the website responsive , it is responsive on small devices(mobile), Tablet, and large Screen.
*  Lastly, I used different types of hooks like(useState, useLoaderData) to add functionality and make this site efficient and smooth.
