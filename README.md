What was done in this project:
* The main focus of this project was, learing the use of react router . So, we applied React-router to navigate the page on place to another.
* Also I applied Re-chart and added a bar chart and showed it on Statistic page UI.
*  I also applied toast component with help of "tostify" package and used it to varify answer of a quiz given by an user valid or not.
* I made the website responsive , it is responsive in small device(mobile), Tablet, and large Screen.
*  lastly I used different types of hooks like(useState, useLoader) to add functinality and make this site efficient and smooth.
